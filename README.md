# Pomodoro Web Timer

A simple pomodoro timer that helps you stay focused and productive.

## Overview

The Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool designed to help you manage your time efficiently. By breaking your work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks, you can maintain high levels of focus and avoid burnout. After completing four intervals, you take a longer break to recharge.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Intervals**: Work for 25 minutes with a countdown timer.
- **Short Breaks**: Take a 5-minute break after each Pomodoro interval.
- **Long Breaks**: After four Pomodoro intervals, take a longer break of 15 minutes.
- **Visual and Audio Alerts**: Receive notifications when it's time to work and when it's time to rest.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust the lengths of work and break periods to fit your personal preferences.
